A (soon to be) universal clipboard manager.


## Overview
**CLPX** is a LAN-based clipboard exchange server built with Flask. It aims to simplify sharing clipboard content between multiple devices on the same network — fast, simple, and cross-platform.


## Features (Planned)
- LAN clipboard sync
- Passphrase authentication
- Clipboard history storage (in-memory / persistent)
- Real-time sync through a websocket
